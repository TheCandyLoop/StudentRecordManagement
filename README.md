# Student Record Management in C

An **in-memory Student Record Management system** implemented in C using linked lists.  
This project demonstrates core **DSA concepts** such as linked lists, searching, sorting, and memory management, making it ideal for learning and interview preparation.

## Features

- Insert new student records
- Display all records
- Search records by ID
- Update existing records
- Delete records by ID
- Sort records by ID, Name, or Marks using merge sort

## Core DSA Concepts

- **Singly Linked Lists** for dynamic memory allocation
- **Merge Sort** for sorting records efficiently
- **Binary Search Logic** for fast search operations
- **Struct-based Abstraction** for organized data management
- **Pointer and Memory Safety** practices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler installed on your system

### Compile and Run

```bash
gcc main.c -o student
./student        # Linux/Mac
student.exe      # Windows
